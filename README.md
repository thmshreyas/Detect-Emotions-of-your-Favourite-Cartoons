# Detect Emotions of Your Favourite Cartoons

## Overview

**Detect-Emotions-of-your-Favourite-Cartoons** is a deep learning project that recognizes and classifies the emotions of cartoon characters from video frames. While emotion recognition in human faces is well-studied, cartoons present unique challenges due to their exaggerated and stylized expressions. This project adapts modern computer vision techniques to the world of animation.

---

## Features

- **Cartoon Face Detection:**  
  Custom-trained face detection models (e.g., YOLOv3, Detectron2) tailored for cartoon characters.
- **Emotion Classification:**  
  Deep neural networks (like ResNet18) classify emotions such as:
  - Happy
  - Angry
  - Sad
  - Surprised
  - Unknown (when no face is detected)
- **Flexible Data Pipeline:**  
  Tools for extracting frames, annotating faces, and preparing datasets for training and evaluation.
- **Custom Dataset Support:**  
  Easily extend the dataset to include more cartoons and characters.

---

## Applications

- Automated analysis of cartoon characters’ emotional expressions.
- Tagging or summarizing emotional content in animated shows.
- Educational tools for teaching emotion recognition and machine learning.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python 3.6+
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Detectron2, YOLOv3
- **Annotation:** LabelImg
- **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas

---

## How It Works

1. **Frame Extraction:**  
   Extract frames from cartoon videos using provided scripts.
2. **Face Annotation:**  
   Annotate faces in frames and convert them to dataset format.
3. **Model Training:**  
   - Train a custom face detector for cartoon characters.
   - Train an emotion classifier on cropped face images.
4. **Prediction:**  
   Detect faces in new frames, classify their emotions, and output labeled results.

## Example Use Case

> Given a Tom & Jerry video, the system detects faces of Tom or Jerry in each frame and classifies their emotional state (happy, angry, sad, surprised). If no face is detected, the emotion is marked as "Unknown".

---

## Why Cartoons?

Cartoon characters have highly expressive, exaggerated emotions, making them a fascinating challenge for emotion recognition. This project demonstrates how deep learning can be adapted to non-human, animated domains.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the [Usage Guide](#) (add link) for data preparation, training, and inference.
